        <p>HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wclasse Web. It is the fifth and final major HTML version that is a World Wclasse Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation.<br>
        HTML5 was first released in a public-facing form on 22 January 2008, with a major update and "W3C Recommendation" status in October 2014. Its goals were to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and other new features;
        to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc.<br>
        Without XHTML's rigclassity; and to remain backward-compatible with older software. HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4 but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.</p>

            HTML5 allows you to build offline applications. Browsers that support HTML5 offline applications (which is most) will download the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and other resources that make up the application and cache them locally.

            HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997. A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the <.canvas> element, in collaboration with javascript.
